# Email Attachment Extraction & Analysis

This guide documents a standard workflow for extracting attachments from phishing emails, generating hashes, and submitting files for further analysis (e.g., on VirusTotal).  
It is intended for use by SOC analysts and anyone investigating suspicious email attachments.

***

## Overview

- **Tool Used:** emldump.py
- **Purpose:** Extract attachments from `.eml` files, calculate SHA-256 hash values, and prepare them for malware analysis.
- **Use Case:** Incident response, phishing investigation, SOC alert triage.

***

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Display Email Structure

Use `emldump.py` to inspect the MIME structure of the email and identify attachments:
```bash
python3 ../Tools/emldump.py sample1.eml
```
- Review the output to identify the part number containing the suspicious attachment.

### 2. Extract the Attachment

Extract the attachment (example assumes part 4 is the file of interest):
```bash
python3 ../Tools/emldump.py sample1.eml -s 4 -d > quotation.iso
```
- This command saves the selected part as `quotation.iso`.

### 3. Generate SHA-256 Hash

Calculate and record the SHA-256 hash of the extracted file for integrity checking and threat intelligence lookup:
```bash
sha256sum quotation.iso
```
- Example result:
  ```
  75fdb848eac332b4ca7d88f497e7ba7ebbb9a798d825b28cf1f87b9d7149e87f  quotation.iso
  ```

### 4. Submit for Malware Analysis

- Upload the extracted file or its SHA-256 hash to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) for scanning and intelligence reporting.
- You can either:
  - Directly upload the file
  - Paste the hash into VirusTotal’s search bar to check for existing reports

## Notes

- Ensure you follow your organization’s policies for handling suspicious files.
- Always work in a secure, controlled environment when dealing with potentially malicious content.
- Document your findings and actions in your case management system.
