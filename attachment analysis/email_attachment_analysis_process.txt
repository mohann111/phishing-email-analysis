# Email Attachment Extraction and Hash Analysis Process

This documentation describes the steps for extracting file attachments from a phishing email using emldump.py, generating a SHA-256 hash, and preparing the file for analysis with VirusTotal.

## Step 1: Extract Email Structure
Run emldump.py to display MIME parts of the EML file:
    python3 ../Tools/emldump.py sample1.eml
Identify the part number of the suspicious attachment.

## Step 2: Extract Attachment
Extract the selected attachment (e.g., part 4, quotation.iso) with:
    python3 ../Tools/emldump.py sample1.eml -s 4 -d > quotation.iso

## Step 3: Calculate SHA-256 Hash
Generate and record the SHA-256 checksum for integrity and malware analysis:
    sha256sum quotation.iso
Sample output:
    75fdb848eac332b4ca7d88f497e7ba7ebbb9a798d825b28cf1f87b9d7149e87f  quotation.iso

## Step 4: Submit for Malware Analysis
Upload the file or use the SHA-256 hash on VirusTotal to check reputation and analysis results:
